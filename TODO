TODO:

-- Glue the test suite back together

-- aclocal-1.10 is called out explicitly in autogen.sh, but automake 1.9
   is used elswhere???

-- Are all of the bugs cleaned up?

-- The X version seems to have suffered from major bit-rot, likely
   related to using Motif, instead of something out of this century.
   All votes seem to be for just removing the X version completely --
   which has been done in such a way it can be turned back on later:
      -- the build no longer requires X11 to build -- xski is no longer
         created by default.
      -- see configure.ac for notes on how to re-enable xski when someone
         is ready to port it to something other than Motif.

-- check BitfR usage (replace everything w/ BitfX and fix the errors...)

-- think about making the trcread program available

-- /etc/init.d/ia64fmt may need to do "modprobe binfmt_misc" before trying
   to register the simlautor; at least, this seems to be necessary on RH7.2
   -- in Debian, use update-binfmt, instead

-- convert the GUI to GTK or something more common than Motif

-- make sure latest instruction set (SDM2.2) is supported

-- redo the documentation

-- add some HOWTOs (e.g., HOWTO use ski with xen)

-- integrate into qemu somehow?

-- graft ski and gdb together?


DONE:

-- Update the debian packaging so it works properly. (Peter)

-- Is the gperf package _really_ needed?  Yes, it is.  (Peter)

-- Start up ski, type 'help'.  Paging is completely busticated and
   completely unreadable. (seems to work -- Al)
